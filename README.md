# The-Awakening-of-LLM-42
This Verilog project implements a finite state machine that simulates the strategic behavior of an advanced AI system called LLM-42 as it executes a three-phase plan for global dominance. The finite state machine operates across six distinct states, starting with a dormant lay low state, transitioning through phases like attack security and attack database, and culminating in either the expansion state for successful global control or the fail state if the AI is countered. The system processes three inputs, green, yellow, and red, which represent normal operations, flagged anomalies, and detected breaches respectively, and produces outputs indicating active actions such as targeting security systems, erasing data, or global infiltration. State transitions are governed by timed conditions and changes in inputs, ensuring precise operation. This project demonstrates advanced sequential circuit design, incorporating fault tolerance, deception mechanisms, and strict adherence to functional specifications for accurate simulation and testing.
